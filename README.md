# Function Plotter

 This is a Python GUI program that allows users to plot arbitrary user-entered functions.   
 The program utilizes PySide2 for the GUI components and Matplotlib for plotting the functions.

 Users can specify the minimum and maximum values of x.    
 Supported operators include +, -, /, *, **, and ^.   
 The program validates user input and provides appropriate error messages.   
 The GUI is well-organized and visually appealing.   
 The Matplotlib figure is embedded within the PySide2 application.   
 Automated tests are included using pytest and pytest-qt for end-to-end testing of the main features.
